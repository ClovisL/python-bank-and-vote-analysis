# PyBank and PyPoll scripts made in python.

## PyBank uses a script to read through a csv file containing profits over 86 months, and analyzes the total profits, as well as the greatest increase/decrease and which month it occured.

## PyPoll uses a script to read through a list of candidates and each vote cast for them. It tallies up each instance of a vote going to a particular candidate, makes a set of each individual candidate, and calculates the percentage of votes they each received. It then gives the name of who won the most votes.
